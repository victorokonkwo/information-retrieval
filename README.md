Information Retrieval Notebook using Sentence Transformer on Colab
This GitHub repository provides a notebook that demonstrates how to perform information retrieval using Sentence Transformer on Google Colab. Sentence Transformer is a Python library for state-of-the-art sentence and text embeddings. This notebook shows how to use Sentence Transformer to retrieve relevant documents based on a query.

## Prerequisites
Before running the notebook, ensure that you have the following prerequisites set up:

- A Google account to access Google Colab.
- A web browser to access Colab.

## Installation
To get started, follow these steps to set up the notebook:

- Clone this GitHub repository to your local machine:

- Copy code

```sh
git clone github.com/victorokonkwo/information-retrieval.git
```

- Upload the notebook file (information_retrieval.ipynb) to your Google Drive.

- Open Google Colab by visiting https://colab.research.google.com/ in your web browser.

- Click on the "File" menu in Colab and select "Open Notebook".

- In the "Upload" tab, click on "Upload" to upload the notebook file from your Google Drive.

- Once the notebook is uploaded, you can open it and follow along with the code and instructions.

## Usage
The notebook provides step-by-step instructions on how to perform information retrieval using Sentence Transformer. It includes code snippets and explanations for each step.

To run the notebook, follow these steps:

- Open the notebook in Colab.

- Click on the "Runtime" menu and select "Run all" to execute all the cells in the notebook.

- Follow the instructions provided in the notebook to input your query and retrieve relevant documents.

You can modify the code or experiment with different parameters to customize the retrieval process according to your needs.

## Resources

information_retrieval.ipynb: The Jupyter notebook that demonstrates how to perform information retrieval using Sentence Transformer on Colab.

## Contributing
If you find any issues with the notebook or have suggestions for improvements, please feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request. Contributions are welcome!

## Limitation
This project encountered a limitation during the development of the API endpoint, as it required additional infrastructure resources. To address this, the next step involves leveraging FastAPI for the development of the ML microservice.

The notebook provided encompasses both the preprocessing phase and the model development process. The information retrieval model implemented within the notebook enables the representation and retrieval of pertinent information from an extensive collection of documents, based on user queries. To enhance scalability, it is possible to utilize big data tools like Apache Spark and employ formats such as parquet, AVRO, or ORC for encoding the data.

In order to create indexes on the document, the faiss Python library was utilized. However, it is important to note that there is still substantial work that lies ahead in terms of further refinement and expansion of the project.
